Description: 
        IPython provides a replacement for the interactive Python interpreter with
        extra functionality.
        
        Main features:
        
        * Comprehensive object introspection.
        
        * Input history, persistent across sessions.
        
        * Caching of output results during a session with automatically generated
        references.
        
        * Readline based name completion.
        
        * Extensible system of 'magic' commands for controlling the environment and
        performing many tasks related either to IPython or the operating system.
        
        * Configuration system with easy switching between different setups (simpler
        than changing $PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables every time).
        
        * Session logging and reloading.
        
        * Extensible syntax processing for special purpose situations.
        
        * Access to the system shell with user-extensible alias system.
        
        * Easily embeddable in other Python programs.
        
        * Integrated access to the pdb debugger and the Python profiler.
        
        The latest development version is always available at the IPython subversion
        repository_.
